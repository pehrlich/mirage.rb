Uses symoblic linking to allow you to work with a reorganized rails directory structure.  Creates the folder mirage/ in your application root, and populates it as mirage/resource/*

Designed to ease the working process of large apps in which navigating from a resource's controller to its model of view is a total pain.

Currently only runs once to create links and then quits, but if you want to add directory watching for actively mirroring files created /app or moving and relinking files in mirage/, you're totally welcome.  I've already done some preliminaries.

Also has the ability to watch sass files automatically.


INSTALLATION

Copy mirage.rb to your applications root folder.  Run with "ruby mirage.rb"

Tested and supports directory structures for rails 2 through 3.1.  May need to be edited to use 'new Proc' rather than 'proc' in older versions of ruby.
